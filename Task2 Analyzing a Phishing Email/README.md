📧 Phishing Email Analysis Report: Phishing-Email-Sample.eml

📝 Project Overview
This project entails a thorough investigation of a phishing email sample (Phishing-Email-Sample.eml) to uncover indicators of compromise (IoCs), malicious attachments, and hidden threats.
The goal is to build hands-on expertise in:

🕵️ Phishing detection
🧪 Email forensics
🌐 Network reconnaissance
… thereby strengthening cybersecurity practices against social engineering attacks.

📂 Sample Source
📥 The suspicious email file "Phishing-Email-Sample.eml" was obtained from a controlled analysis environment, simulating a real-world phishing incident.
🔒 It included encoded attachments and was analyzed in an isolated virtual machine to prevent malware execution.


🔍 Key Analysis Steps
1️⃣ Sender Email Verification
🔎 Reviewed sender’s email address for signs of spoofing (mismatched domains, unusual characters).
🆚 Compared displayed sender name vs. actual From field to detect impersonation.

2️⃣ Email Header Analysis
📬 Used header inspection tools to analyze Received fields & originating IP addresses.
🌎 Checked for routing anomalies, unexpected relays, and suspicious geolocations.

3️⃣ Authentication Protocol Checks
✅ Verified SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication results.
❌ Found failures, confirming spoofed sender and unauthorized email relay.

4️⃣ Content and Language Review
⚠️ Identified urgent and fear-inducing language (e.g., “Immediate action required”).
🖊️ Detected generic greetings (“Dear User”) and grammar/spelling errors common in phishing campaigns.

5️⃣ Attachment and File Analysis
🧩 Decoded Base64-encoded PDF using CyberChef and converted to hex.
📦 Extracted files from a ZIP (DaughtersCrown, GoodJobMajor, Money.xlsx).
🔍 Detected hex mismatch in Money.xlsx → investigated further.
🧑‍💻 Opened spreadsheet in Google Sheets (disposable account).
🗝️ Found hidden Base64 message in Sheet 3 → decoded → revealed IP address 93.99.104.210.

6️⃣ Network Investigations
🌐 Ran traceroute on 93.99.104.210 to analyze network hops.
🛠️ Conducted Nmap stealth SYN scan (-sS) to find open ports, services, and vulnerabilities (within legal limits).

7️⃣ Phishing Characteristics Summary
Compiled technical + linguistic indicators into a final phishing profile report.
🚨 Phishing Indicators Found in Phishing-Email-Sample.eml
🕵️ Spoofed sender address with mismatched domain
❌ SPF, DKIM, DMARC authentication failures
🌎 Suspicious IP paths & forged relays
⚡ Urgent call-to-action messages to pressure recipients
🗂️ Encoded attachments with hex mismatches (possible tampering)
🧑‍💻 Hidden Base64 message → malicious IP address
👤 Generic greetings + grammatical inconsistencies
💻 Attachments potentially delivering malware (MalSpam technique)
🛠️ Tools Used
🔑 CyberChef – Base64 decoding, hex conversion, data extraction
🔢 GHex – Hexadecimal file viewing & verification
🏷️ ExifTool – Metadata analysis of extracted files
📊 Google Sheets (disposable account) – Safe spreadsheet inspection
🌐 Traceroute & Nmap – Network path tracing and port scanning
🖊️ Text Editors & Email Clients – Manual review of headers and content
🎯 Learning Outcomes
✅ Mastered email header dissection and spotting spoofed senders
🧩 Learned attachment forensics and detecting hidden payloads
🌍 Enhanced skills in network reconnaissance & IP investigation
🛡️ Gained awareness of phishing attack vectors and social engineering techniques
📧 Improved understanding of SMTP, POP3, IMAP protocols and email authentication mechanisms to prevent future incidents
